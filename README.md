# Code Challenges

#### *Various online code challenges i've done to improve coding skills. Mostly done in javascript. Each one should contain more details and example in the JS file itself. Below is a brief index.*



## INDEX

1. **no_table_available**: Find number of customers who could not get any table at a resturant
2. **smallest_missing_num**: Find the smallest missing positive number from an unsorted array
3. **flight_paths**: Find itinerary from the given list of departure and arrival airports
4. **maxOfIandJ**: Find the maximum value of `j – i` such that `A[j] > A[i]` in an array
5. **truncated_arrays**: Truncate an integer array such that `2×min` becomes more than `max`
6. **maxIndepentSet**: Given a binary tree, find the size of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) in it.
7. **two_nums**: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
8. **longest_substring**: (**INCOMPLETE**). find the max possible substring without duplicates from an array.
9. **maxPossibleArea**: find the max possible area between array of ints. area is `distance between both * height of the smallest`.
10. **remove Nth Node from end**: given a linked list, remove the nth node from end and return the new head.
11. **matching_parens**: finding matching opening and closing parens, curly or brackets.
12. **reversed_int**: reverse an int. check to see if it's larger than a 32 bit int.
13. **reversed_palindrome**: similar to #12, but with twist that negatives can be returned as false right away. few edge cases.
13. **merge sort linked list**: given two sorted linked lists, combine them into one sorted linked list.
14. **merge n linked lists**: this is similar to #13 but you're given n linked lists, not just 2. the approach i took was the same: add each lists val to a master array. sort that array, then plot each value into a node and link them all. performace was pretty good with this approach. 
15. **search rotated array**: binary search dividing up to find the location of a letter inside a sorted, but rotated array.
16. **wordSearch**: Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
